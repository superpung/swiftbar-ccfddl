## Installation

1. Install [SwiftBar](https://github.com/swiftbar/SwiftBar) and set `Plugin Folder` (e.g., `~/swiftbar/`)
2. Clone this repository to a different directory (e.g., `~/swiftbar/ccfddl/`) and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/swiftbar/ccfddl/
   echo "ccfddl/*" >> ~/swiftbar/.swiftbarignore
   git clone https://github.com/superpung/swiftbar-ccfddl.git ~/swiftbar/ccfddl/
   cd ~/swiftbar/ccfddl/
   uv sync
   # if you don't have `uv` installed, use pip:
   pip install .
   ```

3. Create the assets directory and download CCF deadline YAML files from [ccfddl/ccf-deadlines](https://github.com/ccfddl/ccf-deadlines):

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/swiftbar/assets/ccfddl/
   echo "assets/*" >> ~/swiftbar/.swiftbarignore
   cd ~/swiftbar/assets/ccfddl/
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccfddl/ccf-deadlines/refs/heads/main/conference/SE/icse.yml
   # or download specific conference files as needed
   ```

4. Edit the [`ccfddl.1h.py`](ccfddl.1h.py) script to set the correct path for the python environment (use `which python3`) and CCF deadline YAML files assets:

   ```diff
   - #!/Users/super/i/swiftbar/.venv/bin/python3
   + #!/Users/yourname/swiftbar/ccfddl/.venv/bin/python3
   ...
   - CCFDDL_DIR = os.path.expanduser("~/i/swiftbar/assets/ccfddl")
   + CCFDDL_DIR = os.path.expanduser("~/swiftbar/assets/ccfddl")
   ```

5. Make the script executable and create a symbolic link to the script in your SwiftBar plugins directory:

   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/swiftbar/ccfddl/ccfddl.1h.py
   ln -s ~/swiftbar/ccfddl/ccfddl.1h.py ~/swiftbar/ccfddl.1h.py
   ```

6. Refresh SwiftBar to see the plugin in action!

## Configuration

You can change the filename of the script in the SwiftBar plugin directory to change the update frequency. For example, renaming it to `ccfddl.10m.py` will update every 10 minutes.
